Read YAFTA_Intro.pdf to learn more about these codes.  (A program list
appears near the end of these documents.)

From the IDL prompt, you should be able to enter

IDL> .run YAFTA_test.pro

Then, as IDL commands are discussed in YAFTA_Intro.p*, you should be
able to enter the IDL commands in YAFTA_IDL.pro line by line from the
IDL prompt.

RECENT CHANGES (as of 04 March 2010) ---

* YAFTA_10: Added comments about use of "old_max_label" keyword into
  header of match_features_v01.pro, as well as YAFTA_Intro.pdf. Also
  included explicit use of this keyword in YAFTA_test.pro and
  YAFTA_dualmask.pro

* YAFTA_09: Renamed YAFTA_display.pro to display_yafta.pro, to avoid
  compilation problems with mixed CAPS in filenames.  Also renamed two
  routines that display_yafta.pro calls. Also renamed tvread.pro to 
  tvread_yafta.pro, to avoid conflict with other versions of this 
  routine (one of which is distributed with SSWIDL). Altered IDL programs 
  that call these routines accordingly, and modified documentation to
  reflect these changes.

* YAFTA_08: Fixed a bug in create_features.pro; it was neglecting to 
  create one feature in each frame.  Added a function to create simple, 
  fake data sets, make_test_data.pro.

* YAFTA_07: Fixed a bug in alt_mask.pro; it failed to output mask when
  /unipolar was set.  Renamed it contiguous_mask.pro, and changed call
  in YAFTA_dualmask.pro.

* YAFTA_06: Included keyword to force color selection in
  plot_edges.pro, then fixed a bug introduced in the process.

* YAFTA_05: Fixed a bug in create_features.pro; incorrect indexing led to 
  erroneous computation of velocity moments with LCT flows were also 
  input.

* Since v.04, a YAFTA-specific version of Fen Tamanaha's "display.pro"
  has been used with YAFTA, called YAFTA_display.pro.
