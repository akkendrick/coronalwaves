04 Mar 10 --- Added comment about OLD_MAX_LABEL keyword to 
	      match_features_v01.pro, and modified YAFTA_test.pro and
	      YAFTA_dualmask.pro to include use of this keyword.

17 May 09 --- In plot_edges.pro, converted loop indices to FLOAT, for
	      cases with very large numbers of features.

02 Apr 09 --- Renamed YAFTA_display.pro to display_yafta.pro, to avoid
              compilation problems with mixed CAPS in filenames.  Also
              renamed two routines that display_yafta.pro calls.  Also
              renamed tvread.pro to tvread_yafta.pro, to avoid
              conflict with other versions of this routine (one of
              which is distributed with SSWIDL).  Altered IDL programs
              that call these two routines accordingly, and modified
              documentation to reflect these changes.

21 May 08 --- Fixed a bug in create_features.pro.  An error in the upper 
	      limit of the primary FOR loop caused it to fail to include 
	      pixels in the highest-labelled feature into the FEATURES 
	      array of structures.  Thanks to Rhona Maclean for finding 
	      this bug!

02 May 08 --- Fixed a bug in alt_mask.pro; it failed to output mask
              when /unipolar was set.  Renamed it contiguous_mask.pro,
              and changed call in YAFTA_dualmask.pro. Modified YAFTA_Intro 
	      document. alt_mask.pro is now considered obsolete.

23 Apr 08 --- Updated YAFTA_Intro document (.tex, .pdf, .ps)

02 Apr 08 --- Fixed bug introduced when including "setcolor" keyword in 
	      plot_edges.pro.

11 Mar 08 --- Included "setcolor" keyword in plot_edges.pro, to enable
	      selection of edge color.

07 May 07 --- Fixed bug in create_features.pro.  When local
	      correlation tracking (LCT) velocities were passed to
	      this routine to compute the flux-weighted average LCT
	      velocity for each feature, the indices used for
	      addresses of pixels in the LCT velocity arrays were
	      incorrect.

08 Jul 05 --- Added edgepix keyword to PLOT_EDGES.PRO, to return 1D 
	      addresses of pixels on features' edges.

28 Jun 05 --- R. Maclean (U. of St. Andrews) encountered a bug on a DEC 
	      station, wherein IDL refused to concatenate the anonymous 
	      structures "feature".  A work around was found, in which 
	      named structures are used instead of anonymous structures. 
	      by replacing 
		 	feature = {label:label_j, ...
	      with
			feature = {feature,label:label_j, ...

31 May 05 --- Added set_plot,'ps' before square_plot,'ps' in 
	      YAFTA_test.pro
	  --- Added "if not(keyword_set(ps)) then" prior to 
	      "window,0" call in YAFTA_test.pro
	  --- Changed not(keyword_set(ct)) to (n_elements(ct) eq 0)
	      in PLOT_EDGES.PRO and PLOT_LABELS.PRO.

19 May 05 --- Erroroneous comment in YAFTA_test.pro listed 1433 km 
	      as MDI Hi-Res pixel size; this is actually MDI 
	      Full-Disk pixel size.
	      In CREATE_FEATURES.PRO, included a factor of 2 
	      in .XY and .XYERR fields.

17 May 05 --- Fixed three MAX_COL bugs in PLOT_EDGES.PRO
	  --- Modified code for offset DX in PLOT_EDGES.PRO

16 May 05 --- Included add'l fields in each structure FEATURE, 
	      for calculating errors in position and moments.
	      The square root of the product of the new fields, 
	      XERR, YERR, X2ERR, Y2ERR, and XYERR, and the average 
	      noise per pixel, gives the error in each of these 
	      quantities.

04 May 07 --- Renamed display.pro to YAFTA_display.pro, for version
              control perposes.


09 May 05 --- Wrote dual-label logic, for tracking both contiguous and 
	      convex features in parallel.  Included new string-
	      valued field ALT_LABEL, and routines ALT_MASK.PRO 
	      (which uses IDL's LABEL_REGION.PRO) and MATCH_MASKS.PRO.
	      Use main-level code YAFTA_DUALMASK.PRO for such tracking.

28 Apr 05 --- Changed .SRC, .TRM, .LABEL fields to longword integer.
	      (Integer overflow occurred w/more than ~32,000 features.)

12 APR 05 --- Added .maxb field to structure in create_features.pro
