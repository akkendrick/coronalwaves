    	<h2 id="sec1"><b>1. What is CorWav?</b></h2>
    	<p>CorWav is a library of Interactive Data Language (IDL) tools for the manipulation and analysis of 
    	large-scale waves (and related phenomena) in the solar corona ("CorWav" comes from "coronal waves").
    	 It has been designed to be used with the <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/" target="_blank">SolarSoft</a> 
    	 IDL package of solar and heliospheric physics tools.
    	 CorWav is freely available, and can be downloaded/forked from <a href="https://github.com/kkozarev/coronalwaves" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (Git 
    	 help is <a href="https://help.github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>). The main suite of tools was designed to analyze EUV wave 
    	 observations from the 
    	 Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. 
    	 However, the code has been written with flexibility and modularity in mind, so it may be easily 
    	 modified to incorporate new types of data or data-driven models.</p>

    	<section>
    	<h2 id="sec2"><b>2. What tools does CorWav include?</b></h2>
    	<p>CorWav includes tools to analyze the radial and lateral kinematics of coronal bright fronts/EUV waves, 
    	as well as their other properties: wave sheath thickness, density and temperature change,
    	their interaction with the coronal magnetic field (shock-to-magnetic-field angles, heliospheric connectivity).
    	The framework includes tools for making various kinds of images and movies from AIA data, as well as for plotting
    	images and data from other instruments.</p>

    	<section>
    	<h2 id="sec3"><b>3. Setting up your local copy of CorWav.</b></h2>
    	<p>You can download your local copy of CorWav from <a href="https://github.com/kkozarev/coronalwaves" target="_blank">here</a>, 
    	or by running the following in your
    	command line terminal (assuming you have git installed):
    	<pre><code>
$> git clone https://github.com/kkozarev/coronalwaves corwav
    	</code></pre>
    	This will download a copy of the code into the local folder 'corwav'.</p>
    	<p>After this, there are several steps to take in order to ensure you can access the procedures and run them properly.
    	First, you need to add some global variables to your linux/unix-like environment. Luckily,
    	there's a script that can do that for you. Open the file <b>set_paths.sh</b> in gen/ directory of the code folder - 
    	you should see several variables like this near the top:
    	<pre><code>
#set CORWAV to the directory where analyzed events will be stored
CORWAV="/Volumes/Backscratch/Users/kkozarev/corwav/"
#set CORWAV_DATA to the directory where the local copy of data will live
CORWAV_DATA="/Volumes/Itch/Users/kkozarev/corwav/"
#set CORWAV_TRUNK to the directory of the CorWav code (or local copy of the repository)
CORWAV_TRUNK="${HOME}/git/corwav/"
#set CORWAV_WEB to directory where the web database page is.
CORWAV_WEB="/var/www/personal/kkozarev/public_html/"
</code></pre>
		Edit these to point to the code location (CORWAV_TRUNK), archived local data (CORWAV_DATA), the directory where analyzed data will live (CORWAV), 
		and (optionally) the web database directory (CORWAV_WEB). Save and execute the script.</p>

    	<h2 id="sec4"><b>4. Creating and loading an event.</b></h2>
    	<p>An 'event' is a structure containing the necessary information that CorWav tools use to load and process coronal wave and 
    	related data, for a given solar eruption event. This information is instrument-independent. CorWav provides a human-readable, 
    	easy to use
    	<a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON</a> format for loading event data into IDL. Here is an example of the 
    	input format for a single event:</p>
    	<pre><code>
{
 "label": "110809_01",
 "coordX": 883,
 "coordY": 269,
 "st": "2011/08/09 07:55:00",
 "et": "2011/08/09 08:20:00",
 "aiafov": [1024,2048],
 "flareclass": "X6.9",
 "typeII": true,
 "loop": false,
 "filament": true,
 "comment": "Large shock wave inside the limb propagates southward.",
 "ips_lookup": "",
 "callisto_lookup": "http://soleil.i4ds.ch/solarradio/qkl/2011/08/09/ALMATY_20110809_080000_59.fit.gz.png",
 "nrh_lookup": "http://secchirh.obspm.fr/survey.php?hour=0800&dayofyear=20110809&composite=2"
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>The JSON format has elements (such as "label"), which have certain values (such as "110809_01"), assigned with the ':' character. 
        The elements are separated by commas.
        Text values must be surrounded in quotation marks, unlike numbers. The format also accepts an array of values 
        (such as "aiafov": [1024,2048]), 
        or boolean values (such as "filament": true). 
        Every instance of the structure format is surrounded by curly brackets. White space is unimportant for the JSON format, but it is very 
        important for readable code.</p>
        <p>Let's look at the elements in the event structure. The first one,
        <pre><code>
 {"label": "110809_01"}
        </code></pre>
        is the unique label of the event. Its format is YYMMDD_NN, where YYMMDD is the date, and NN is the consecutive number of this event 
        in the database for that date. 
        Thus, "110809_01" is the first event of 9 August, 2011 in the event database. The event label is very important, since it is used to 
        uniquely identify an event, along with all its information.</p>
		<pre><code>
{"coordX": 883,
 "coordY": 269,
 "st": "2011/08/09 07:55:00",
 "et": "2011/08/09 08:20:00"}
        </code></pre>
        <p>The next few elements specify the time and space position of the event. 
        The first two, "coordX" and "coordY", give the coordinates, in arcseconds, of the origin of the eruption on the solar disk 
        (these can be obtained most easily from <a href="http://lmsal.com/isolsearch" target="_blank">Heliospheric Event Knowledgebase (HEK)</a>).
        These coordinates are used to determine the position of the event on AIA images and to automatically cut a subregion around it, together 
        with the "aiafov" element (see below).
        "st" and "et" give the starting and ending times for the event. They are used to automatically fetch only the necessary data files for 
        analysis.
        Note the particular datetime format, which is required for CorWav to parse the information properly.</p>
        <pre><code>
{ 
 "aiafov": [1024,2048],
 "flareclass": "X6.9",
 "typeII": true,
 "loop": false,
 "filament": true
}
        </code></pre>
        <p> The "aiafov" element holds the X- and Y-sizes (in pixels) for the field of view to cut out from the 4k-by-4k pixels of the original 
        AIA data (Using the entire image is rarely necessary). The "flareclass" element holds the X-ray class of the flare (if there isn't one, 
        leave a blank string). 
        The best place to search for the class of a flare is <a href="http://www.solarmonitor.org" target="_blank">Solar Monitor</a>, 
        or <a href="http://lmsal.com/isolsearch" target="_blank">HEK</a>. The next three elements take boolean values 'true' or 'false', 
        depending on whether there was metric radio type II emission, expanding loops, or filaments.</p>
	    <pre><code>
{ 
 "comment": "Large shock wave inside the limb propagates southward.",
 "ips_lookup": "",
 "callisto_lookup": "http://soleil.i4ds.ch/solarradio/qkl/2011/08/09/ALMATY_20110809_080000_59.fit.gz.png",
 "nrh_lookup": "http://secchirh.obspm.fr/survey.php?hour=0800&dayofyear=20110809&composite=2"
}
        </code></pre>  
        <p>The element "comment" holds a free-form comment on the appearance and any interesting features of the particular event, by (ideally) 
        the person who submits it. 
        The last three elments hold the urls or file names of quicklook plots of metric radio emission during the event, from three different 
        networks of solar radio observatories. 
        If no quicklook plots are available, this field should be left a blank string.</p>
        <p>All the event entries (individual structures) must be written/added to the file <b>'events.json'</b> in the <b>dat/</b> folder of 
        your local CorWav copy.
        CorWav knows to search for event information there. You can access the information you entered, and more, for a single event, by 
        using the load_events_info() 
        function and specifying the event label:
        <pre><code>
IDL> event=load_events_info(label='110809_01')
IDL> help,event
EVENT           STRUCT    = -> <Anonymous> Array[1]
        </code></pre> 
        The result is a structure, let's see what's inside.

As you can see, the structure contains not only the information we supplied through the JSON format, but a lot of additional information as 
well - 
such as all the necessary input and output directory paths, correction factors, active region coordinates in degrees, and a geometric 
correction factor
(more on that later). You can load all the event information at once, by running load_events_info() with no arguments:</p>
        <pre><code>
IDL> events=load_events_info()
IDL> help,event
EVENTS           STRUCT    = -> <Anonymous> Array[27]
        </code></pre>
<p>Let's go back to event '110809_01'. Once you have its event structure loaded, you can pass it as an argument to many CorWav tools. 
Next, you will see how to load some AIA data and make movies from it.
Oh, and by the way, calling load_events_info for the first time for an event causes it to create the event's directory tree in the 
CORWAV directory, so no need to worry about that.</p>

        <section>
    	<h2 id="sec5"><b>5. Loading AIA data. Processing AIA data, making images and movies.</b></h2>
    	<p>To load and preprocess (prep) AIA data, use the aia_load_data procedure. 
    	It loads the AIA data from the local (or remote archive), preprocesses/calibrates it, and saves it as a datacube in the appropriate 
    	location in the event's directory.</p>
        <pre><code>
IDL> event=load_events_info(label='110809_01')
IDL> wav=['193','211'] ;The AIA (best for waves) waveband channels for which to load data.
;To load all EUV channels, use the following instead:
;wav=['94','131','171','193','211','335']
;For every waveband, execute aia_load_event:
IDL> for w=0,n_elements(wav)-1 do $
	 aia_load_event,event,wav[w],$
		index=index,data=data,$
		subindex=subindex,subdata=subdata,$
		map=map,/remove_aec,/subroi,/force
        </code></pre>
        <p> The procedure 'aia_load_event' is a wrapper for the powerful 'aia_load_data'. It loads, preps, normalizes the files for the given
        waveband channel, and saves them as a datacube in the event main folder. The '/subroi' keyword tells aia_load_event to also create a datacube
        of reduced proportions, based on the AR coordinates and cutout size (event.aiafov), specified in the event's JSON description. 
        The '/force' keyword tells the procedure to overwrite whatever data there is already loaded. The 'index' and 'data' keywords will return
        the index structure and datacube for the event. For the sub-fov data, 'subindex' and 'subdata' do the same. <b>The data and subdata will be 
        saved to the event folder regardless of whether these keywords are supplied.</b>
        aia_load_data has many other options, which you can find by opening the file CORWAV_TRUNK/aia/aia_load_data.pro. For example, an 
        important option is to not include files with much shorter exposure that are often created during flares, 
        by supplying the /remove_aec keyword. <b>In general, most of the procedures have additional keywords, described in the individual
        procedure files in the CORWAV_TRUNK folder.</b></p>
        <p> Once aia_load_data has executed successfully, you can make image files from the data, like this (1024x2048 px) base difference image: <img src="png/aia_baseim.png" alt='AIA base difference image'>
        <pre><code>
IDL> for w=0,n_elements(wav)-1 do aia_make_images,event,wav[w],/raw,/base,/run,/force
        </code></pre>
        The '/raw','/base','/run' keywords tell the procedure to make image files from the raw data (with an inverted color table 
        to highlight the faint waves), base difference images (subtracting the first image from all consequent ones), or running difference
        images (subtracting the preceding image from the next one). Running the above will create PNG files in 
        CORWAV/events/110809_01/png/[type]/[wav]/,type being one of raw/base/run.</p>
        <p>You can also create annulus images. Those are images, created by 'deprojecting' the solar image onto a rectangular canvas, where
        the X-axis is angular distance from solar north along the limb, and the Y-axis is radial distance from Sun-center.
        <pre><code>
IDL> for w=0,n_elements(wav)-1 do aia_annulus_create,event,/raw,/base,/run,wav=wav[w],/force
        </code></pre>
        Running the above will create PNG files in CORWAV/events/110809_01/annulusplot/[type]/[wav]/, 
        type being one of araw/abase/arun. <br>A base difference annulus image looks like this: <img src="png/aia_annplot_baseim.png" alt='AIA annulus base difference image'></p>
        
        <p>Now that we have created some images, we can create time lapse movies from them, like so:
        <pre><code>
IDL> movie_types=['run','arun']
;If you want to make all types of movie, use this instead
;movie_types=['araw','abase','arun','raw','base','run']
IDL> for w=0,n_elements(wav)-1 do $
	    for mt=0,n_elements(movie_types)-1 do $
		   aia_make_movies, event, movie_type=movie_types[mt], wav=wav[w],/force
        </code></pre>
        We just made a running difference and annulus running difference .mp4 movies for this event. They will be stored in 
        CORWAV/events/110809_01/movies/. The '$' sign in the IDL code above just allows to break the line without IDL breaking.</p>

        <section>
    	<h2 id="sec6"><b>6. Measuring EUV wave kinematics.</b></h2>
    	<p>There are different ways to measure how fast the wave is moving and how much it is accelerating/decelerating as a function of time.
    	The usual way is to record the pixel values along a single radial line passing through the wave front and through the center of the Sun,
    	as a function of time. This way, we can measure the evolution of the apparent edge (front) of the wave in the radial direction. The annulus images allow
    	us to do that, but they also allow us to easily measure the lateral motion of the wave at different heights above the solar limb, 
    	which can give us information about the local plasma properties, as well as the eruptive feature that drives the wave. We will start
    	with the radial measurements. The procedure to use is 'aia_annulus_analyze_radial' (interactive):</p>
        <pre><code>
IDL> rrange=[1.1,1.37] ;The radial range of the annulus to use (Rs)
IDL> for w=0,n_elements(wav)-1 do aia_annulus_analyze_radial,event,wave=wav[w],rrange=rrange,/constrain
        </code></pre>
        <p>The rrange keyword contains the radial range of the annulus image to use, in solar radii. The 'constrain' keyword tells the procedure
        to constrain the wave front to behave physically, allowing radial speeds between 10 and 1500 km/s. The procedure is interactive, and
        will produce a plot like this: <img src="png/aia_annplot_radial.png" alt='AIA annulus base difference image' width=500> <br>
        It will be automatically saved as a .png file in the CORWAV/events/110809_01/annulusplot/ folder, together with all the variables in a
        .sav file. The black line is a fit to the front of the wave, with the fit parameters written on the plot. The white vertical lines are
        the start and end times for fitting the wave front - these must be supplied by the user of the procedure (currently). The underlying
        greyscale plot was made by taking one column of the annulus image (centered on the AR position) at every time step, and stacking it next
        to the others. This produces a time-height plot, also known as a 'J-map'.</p>
